/// <summary>
/// Reconstructs the history of an AssignedSite's <c>UseOneMinuteIntervals</c>
/// flag from its <c>AssignedSiteVersions</c> audit rows so read/display/calc
/// paths can resolve the mode that was IN FORCE when a given row was
/// registered ("mode at registration") instead of the site's current flag.
///
/// Why: a row registered under 5-minute mode carries tick ids as its truth;
/// a row registered under one-minute mode carries exact stamps. When a site
/// flips the flag, per-site forking silently reinterprets historical rows
/// (tick rows suddenly render/pay from raw stamps → drift in every total).
/// Discriminating on stamp-nullness does not work either, because exact
/// stamps exist on virtually all tick rows (devices record them alongside
/// the tick ids). The reliable discriminator is this timeline.
///
/// Schema quirk (verified in prod): <c>PnBase.MapVersion</c> copies EVERY
/// property of the base entity onto the version row — including
/// <c>CreatedAt</c>, which therefore always holds the BASE entity's original
/// creation time on every version row. The actual save time of a version row
/// is its <c>UpdatedAt</c> (PnBase sets the base entity's UpdatedAt to
/// UtcNow immediately before mapping the version). Change points are hence
/// derived from consecutive version rows' flag values using UpdatedAt as the
/// transition instant, ordered by version row Id (insert order).
///
/// Date granularity: comparisons are DATE-ONLY. A flag flip saved mid-day
/// governs that WHOLE day under the new value — a PlanRegistration's Date is
/// a midnight anchor with no time-of-day, so a finer resolution is not
/// representable; making the flip day take the new mode matches the
/// operational reality that the flip is done before/with the first
/// registrations the admin wants under the new mode.
///
/// Edge cases:
///  - No version rows at all → the site's CURRENT flag for all dates.
///  - Flag already true in the earliest version row → true from the
///    beginning of time (dates before the first row exist only for rows
///    created before the audit row — same mode as at creation).
///  - Multiple toggles → interval walk over the change points; several
///    toggles on the same date → the last save wins.
///  - Divergence correction: when the entity's CURRENT flag differs from the
///    last audited version value, the flag was flipped OUTSIDE the audited
///    path (raw-SQL ops change, or a CI seed whose dump predates the column —
///    PnBase writes a version row on every API save, so a complete trail
///    always ends on the current value). The exact flip time is unknowable,
///    so the current flag takes over from the LAST audited save date — the
///    earliest possible un-audited flip point. Audited history before that
///    date is preserved; for sites flipped through the API this is a no-op.
///
/// Authoritative override: <c>AssignedSite.UseOneMinuteIntervalsFrom</c>.
/// The derived timeline above is a RECONSTRUCTION; when ops (or the
/// settings save in <c>TimeSettingService.UpdateAssignedSite</c>) has
/// recorded the date the flag actually took effect, that stored date is the
/// truth and the reconstruction is not consulted at all:
///   <c>UseOneMinuteIntervals &amp;&amp; rowDate &gt;= UseOneMinuteIntervalsFrom</c>
/// (date-only, same granularity rule as above). A NULL column means "nothing
/// recorded" and falls through to the derived timeline, which keeps today's
